1. Compute Engine (Virtual Machines)

Explanation:
Compute Engine provides scalable, customizable virtual machines (VMs) running in Google Cloud. You can configure CPU, memory, storage, and OS to match your application needs.
Practical:

Launch a VM instance via Cloud Console or CLI.

Use it to run applications, host websites, or manage backend services.

2. App Engine (Managed App Hosting)

Explanation:
App Engine is a fully managed platform for building and deploying applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Supports popular languages like Python, Java, Node.js.
Practical:

Deploy code using simple commands; scaling and load balancing are automatic.

3. Cloud Functions (Serverless Functions)

Explanation:
Cloud Functions lets you run event-driven code snippets without managing servers. Functions respond to triggers like HTTP requests, database changes, or messaging events.
Practical:

Write a function that automatically resizes images when uploaded to Cloud Storage.

4. Cloud Dataflow (Basic Data Pipelines)

Explanation:
Dataflow is a fully managed service for creating data processing pipelines, useful for ETL tasks and real-time analytics. It uses Apache Beam SDK for pipeline development.
Practical:

Create a pipeline that reads data from Pub/Sub, transforms it, and writes to BigQuery.

5. Cloud Dataproc (Hadoop and Spark for Basic Data Processing)

Explanation:
Dataproc offers managed Hadoop and Spark clusters to process large datasets quickly and cost-effectively. It’s ideal for batch processing, data transformations, and machine learning workloads.
Practical:

Spin up a Spark cluster, run data jobs, then shut it down to save costs.

6. Cloud SQL (Data Storage for Data Analysis)

Explanation:
Cloud SQL provides fully managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server). It’s optimized for data storage and analysis with easy maintenance and backups.
Practical:

Use Cloud SQL as the backend database for your application or BI tools.

7. Cloud IoT Core (Device Management) & Cloud Pub/Sub (Real-time Data Messaging) & Cloud Storage (Data Storage for Sensor Data)

Explanation:

Cloud IoT Core: Securely connects and manages IoT devices.

Cloud Pub/Sub: Messaging service for ingesting and delivering real-time data streams.

Cloud Storage: Scalable object storage ideal for sensor data and backups.
Practical:

IoT Core registers devices → devices send data to Pub/Sub → messages stored in Cloud Storage.

8. Cloud Console (Web Interface), Cloud Monitoring (Basic Monitoring), Cloud Billing (Cost Management)

Explanation:

Cloud Console: Web-based UI to manage Google Cloud resources.

Cloud Monitoring: Tracks performance and uptime of cloud services.

Cloud Billing: Provides visibility and control over cloud costs and budgets.
Practical:

Use Cloud Console for resource deployment, Monitoring to set alerts, and Billing to track usage.

9. AI Platform Notebooks (Basic AI Exploration), Vertex AI Workbench (Managed Environment for Data Science Projects), BigQuery ML (Basic Machine Learning within BigQuery), TensorFlow (Open-source ML Library), Cloud TPUs (Accelerated Hardware for TensorFlow), Cloud AI Platform Training (Managed Training for ML Models)

Explanation:

AI Platform Notebooks & Vertex AI Workbench: Managed Jupyter notebooks for data science and ML model development.

BigQuery ML: Enables machine learning model creation directly within BigQuery using SQL syntax.

TensorFlow: Open-source library to build and train ML models.

Cloud TPUs: Specialized hardware to accelerate TensorFlow model training and inference.

AI Platform Training: Managed service for training ML models at scale.
Practical:

Develop models in notebooks, train with AI Platform, deploy and accelerate using TPUs.

10. Cloud VPN (Secure Connections), Cloud DNS (Managed DNS), Cloud Load Balancing (Distributes Traffic)

Explanation:

Cloud VPN: Creates secure, encrypted connections between on-premises networks and Google Cloud.

Cloud DNS: Scalable and managed DNS service for domain name resolution.

Cloud Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend resources to ensure reliability and scalability.
Practical:

Use VPN to securely connect your infrastructure; DNS for domain management; Load Balancer to improve app availability.
